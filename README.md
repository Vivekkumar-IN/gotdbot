**gotdbot** is a powerful, pure Go wrapper for [TDLib](https://github.com/tdlib/td) (Telegram Database Library). It provides a simple and idiomatic way to build Telegram clients and bots using Go.

Current Version: **v0.9.2** and TDLib **v1.8.64**.

## Features

- **Pure Go**: No CGO mess in your application code (uses `purego` to load `libtdjson`).
- **High Performance**: Direct binding to TDLib's JSON interface.
- **Dispatcher System**: Built-in update dispatcher with middleware-style handlers.
- **Filters**: Powerful and composable filters for message matching.
- **Type-Safe**: Fully generated Go structs for all TDLib types and methods.
- **Context Aware**: Easy access to effective messages, chats, and users.
